        <h2>Its a heading </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          This is a paragraph, its pretty cool... There isn't much more to see here I'm afraid
        </p>
        <p> 
          Still nothing to see here, this text means absolutely nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay you can leave now. Still nothing to see its just placeholder text.

        <br>

        <p> There is no projects because this was a tutorial and I haven't made stuff yet.</p>

        <p> still nothing to see unfortunately.</p>

        <p> This is some more placeholder text.</p>

        <h2> Accomplishments</h2>

        <p> Nothing unfortunately, not very talented.</p>

        <p> I mean I finished this tutorial so thats something.</p>

        <p> I'm also busy with a game using canvas and vanilla js its super simple but I guess that's something</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2> Work history</h2>
        <br>

        <h3> McDonalds</h3>
        <p> I stole this from the tutorial but thought it was funny.</p>
        <h3>Taco Bell</h3>
        <p> Some more placeholder text, I know its crazy</p>
        <h3>Burger King</h3>
        <p> Burger King kind of sucks, hope I'm not the only one who thinks that.</p>
